# Note App
##### A simple note web app, where a user can write a note, save a note, view a list of their notes, and delete a note. The userâ€™s notes are saved so that they are available via any web-capable device.

### High Level Design
The user will communicate with the Note App using the web browser ui.From the browser the user will send (http) request and
will receive (http) responses.

### Web Server
 By creating Spring Boot based web application we will use embedded Tomcat with web dependency and run the app on
 our machine or on any cloud service provider (Heroku, AWS, GCP, Azure).In case we want to persist the data on a 
 database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) we can configure the application with Spring Data or we can use H2 (in memory)
